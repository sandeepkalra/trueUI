    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h3>Who We Are and What This Is</h3>

    <p>
      SahiJawaab is a set of Q&A sites dedicated to providing high-quality questions and answers, with the modest goal
      of making the Internet a better place. It is owned and operated by Kalra InfoSystems Pvt. Ltd., India.
    </p>
    <p>
      We take the private nature of your personal information very seriously, and are committed to protecting it. To do
      that, we’ve set up procedures to ensure that your information is handled responsibly and in accordance with
      applicable data protection and privacy laws. We’re grateful for your trust, and we’ll act that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      This privacy policy describes what information we collect when you visit the network, how we use that
      information, and what choices we offer you to access, update, and control it. This version of the policy is
      effective as of June 20, 2017.
    </p>

    <h3>Types of Information</h3>
    <p>
      “Personal information” is any information that we could use to identify an individual. It does not include
      personal information that is encoded or anonymized, or publicly available information that has not been combined
      with non-public information.

      “Sensitive personal information” is information that meets the “personal information” criteria and also a) reveals
      race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or b)
      concerns health or sex life, information about social security benefits, or information on criminal or
      administrative proceedings other than in the context of pending legal proceedings.
    </p>

    <h3>How We Collect Information</h3>
    <p>
      We collect information two ways: Information we get from your use of the network, and information you provide to
      us
      directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Information we get from your use of the network is primarily non-personally- identifying information of the sort
      that web browsers, servers, and services like Google Analytics typically make available, such as the browser type,
      language preference, referring site, and the time of each visit. Other non-identifying information that we might
      have access to includes how you use the service (e.g., search queries), your approximate location, cookies, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      We collect this non-personally identifying information in order to better understand how visitors use the service
      and where possible, to improve their experience. For instance, we may monitor the most common content on the
      network
      to help identify spam. In some cases, we may publicly display information that is not personally identifying in
      the
      aggregate, (e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the network,) or may provide it to third
      parties
      for educational or similar purposes other than for sale or profit.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you use the network, we also collect potentially personally identifying information in the form of Internet
      Protocol (IP) addresses. But we don’t use that information to identify you, and we handle and disclose these
      addresses in the same way we handle other potentially personally identifying information as described below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Information you provide to us directly. Certain visitors to the network choose to interact with it in ways that
      may
      require them to provide us with personally identifying information. The amount and type of information that is
      provided depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for SahiJawaab.com to
      provide a username and email address. Employers who engage in financial transactions with www.SahiJawaab.com are
      asked to provide additional information, such as the personal and financial information required to process those
      transactions. We use a payment gateway to protect financial information we collect online and secure payment
      processors to carry out financial transactions. We only collect as much information as is necessary or appropriate
      given the type of interaction. We do not disclose personally identifying information other than as described
      below.
      And you can always refuse to supply personally identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent you
      from
      engaging in certain activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you send us a request, such as emailing us for support, we reserve the right to publish it (absent any
      personally
      identifying information) in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or help other users.

      A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser
      provides to the website each time the visitor returns. We use cookies to help us track visitors’ use of the
      network
      and their preferences. If you do not wish to have cookies placed on your computer, you should set your browser to
      refuse cookies, but should be aware that certain features of the network may not function properly without them.

      If you are outside the United States, you should know that any personally identifiable information you enter into
      the network will be transferred out of your country and into the United States, and possibly to other countries.
      By
      using the network, you consent to such transfer, and are representing that you have the right to transfer such
      information outside your country.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If you
      believe that a child has provided us with personally identifiable information without the consent of his or her
      parent or guardian, please contact us at support@SahiJawaab.com If we become aware that a child under age 13 has
      provided us with personally identifiable information, we’ll delete it.

      Information You Choose to Display Publicly on the Network
      Some users may elect to publicly post personally identifying or sensitive information about themselves in their
      normal use of the network. This could occur through use of the optional profile fields, in question or answer
      posts,
      or when an individual posts a job history on the Jobs site. Information like that, which is voluntarily posted in
      publicly visible parts of the network, is considered to be public, even if it would otherwise be considered to be
      personally identifying or sensitive. As such, it is not subject to the protocols listed below, because we don’t
      control it; you do. Additionally, voluntarily publicizing such information means that you lose any privacy rights
      you might normally have with regards to that information. It also increases your chances of receiving unwanted
      communications, like spam.

      Information You Give to Other People
      This Policy only applies to information collected by SahiJawaab. It does not apply to the practices of companies
      that we don’t own or control, or employees that we don’t manage. The network contains links to third party
      websites,
      and any information you provide to those sites will be covered by any privacy policies they may have. Please be
      sure
      to read the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit. It is those sites’ responsibility to protect any
      information you give them, so we can’t be held liable for their wrongful use of your personally identifying
      information.

      How We Use Information We Collect
      When we collect your personal information, we’ll tell you how we’re using it, any types of third parties to which
      we
      might disclose it, (other than moderators or “agents,” such as vendors or contractors, who are only processing
      such
      information for us or at our direction), and the choices we offer you to limit the use of your information.

      Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when you are first asked to provide us with personal
      information, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and we’ll notify you before we use the information for
      something
      other than the purpose for which it was originally collected. If anything in this Policy seems unclear, please
      don’t
      hesitate to contact us at http://www.SahiJawaab.com/contact-us, so we can address your question and possibly
      clarify
      this document.

      Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may need to change this Policy. If we do update it, we’ll notify
      you either by posting the new policy on the network or by emailing you the changes or a link to the modified
      document. (See the “Choice” section below for information about how we’ll notify you if we change our policy
      regarding sensitive information.) In any case, the way we use information you provide will be covered by the
      privacy
      policy that was in effect at the time it was collected.

      Here are some of the ways we may use personal information you provide us:

      To allow you to register for our web sites, online communities and other services, and to administer and process
      those registrations
      To communicate with you about our products, services and related issues
      To evaluate the quality of our products and services, and to enhance your experience on our web sites
      To help employers find or contact users who post profiles on the Jobs site
      To maintain and administer our web sites and comply with our legal or internal obligations and policies
      To transfer information to others as described in this policy or to satisfy our legal, regulatory, compliance, or
      auditing requirements
      Choice – Choice is all about making sure you have the ability to control how we share your personal information
      with
      others. We want you to be in control of your own data disclosure. To that end, we allow anonymous and pseudonymous
      participation, allow you to disable several features from public share settings, and to personalize your data
      features and share settings at: http://SahiJawaab.com/user/
      edit. We almost never share any of your personal information with non-agent third parties, with one exception,
      where you basically are asking us to do so: It’s hard to imagine that we would ever consider collecting, let alone
      sharing, sensitive information with a non-agent third party, but if such a day should come, we will first give you
      the opportunity to explicitly consent (opt-out) to such disclosure or to any use of the information for a purpose
      other than the one for which it was originally collected or previously authorized.

      If you are a registered user of the network and have supplied your email address, we may occasionally send you an
      email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with
      the network. We generally use the network to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type
      of communication to a minimum. If we do send you information that you did not expressly request, we will provide
      you with a way to request that you don’t get any similar notices (opt-out).

      Security
      All records containing personal or financial information are considered to be our property and are afforded
      confidential treatment at all times. We work hard to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or
      destruction of personal or financial information. All such electronic information is stored on restricted database
      servers, and is generally kept until such time as you may ask us to edit or delete it, as described below. We only
      disclose such information to our employees, agents or affiliates that a) need to know that information in order to
      process it for us or to provide other services, b) have agreed not to disclose it to others, and c) in response to
      lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

      Data Integrity
      In addition to assuring you that we will protect your personal information, we also want to make sure that it is
      reliable, accurate, and up-to-date. In order to do that, we provide:

      Access
      Upon request, we will provide you with reasonable access to the personal information we collect about you. You
      will have the opportunity to correct, update, modify or delete this information by sending an e-mail to
      CTO@KalraInfoSystems.com. Please note that some information may remain in our records even after you request
      deletion of your information as permitted by the Privacy Shield Principles. Additionally, there may be limits to
      the amount of information we can practically provide. For example, we may limit an individual’s access to personal
      information where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the
      individual’s privacy or where doing so would violate others’ rights.

      Enforcement
      We will conduct internal audits of our compliance with this privacy policy, including an annual self-assessment.
      Our employees take your privacy as seriously as we do, and we will take all reasonable measures against any
      employee found to be in violation of this policy.

      If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint
      to your satisfaction, please contact us using our contact us form at http://www.SahiJawaab.com/contact-us or mail
      us at G-9, First Floor, South City2 Gurugram, Haryana, India 122018.
